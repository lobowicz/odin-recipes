    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africa’s most popular dish. I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large, ripe tomato, cored and quartered</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 whole habenero pepper, stem removed</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.</li>
    </ol>
